## **Section 1: RAG, LlamaIndex, and Vector Storage**

### **What is the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)?**

- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) : Integrates the retrieval (searching) into LLM text generation. RAG helps the model to ‚Äúlook up‚Äù external information to improve its responses. [cite](https://towardsdatascience.com/rag-vs-finetuning-which-is-the-best-tool-to-boost-your-llm-application-94654b1eaba7) [25 Aug 2023]

  <!-- <img src="../files/RAG.png" alt="sk" width="400"/> -->

- In a 2020 paper, Meta (Facebook) came up with a framework called retrieval-augmented generation to give LLMs access to information beyond their training data. [Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11401): [[cnt](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=arxiv%3A+2005.11401)] [22 May 2020]

  1. RAG-sequence ‚Äî We retrieve k documents, and use them to generate all the output tokens that answer a user query.
  1. RAG-token‚Äî We retrieve k documents, use them to generate the next token, then retrieve k more documents, use them to generate the next token, and so on. This means that we could end up retrieving several different sets of documents in the generation of a single answer to a user‚Äôs query.
  1. Of the two approaches proposed in the paper, the RAG-sequence implementation is pretty much always used in the industry. It‚Äôs cheaper and simpler to run than the alternative, and it produces great results.

We propose RECOMP (Retrieve, Compress, Prepend), an intermediate step which compresses retrieved documents into a textual summary prior to prepending them to improve retrieval-augmented language models (RALMs). 2. We present two compressors ‚Äì an `extractive compressor` which selects useful sentences from retrieved documents and an `abstractive compressor` which generates summaries by synthesizing information from multiple documents. 3. Both compressors are trained. [6 Oct 2023]

  1. Data quality: Clean, standardize, deduplicate, segment, annotate, augment, and update data to make it clear, consistent, and context-rich.
  2. Embeddings fine-tuning: Fine-tune embeddings to domain specifics, adjust them according to context, and refresh them periodically to capture evolving semantics.
  3. Retrieval optimization: Refine chunking, embed metadata, use query routing, multi-vector retrieval, re-ranking, hybrid search, recursive retrieval, query engine, [HyDE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10496) [20 Dec 2022], and vector search algorithms to improve retrieval efficiency and relevance.
  4. Synthesis techniques: Query transformations, prompt templating, prompt conditioning, function calling, and fine-tuning the generator to refine the generation step.
  - HyDE: Implemented in [LangChain: HypotheticalDocumentEmbedder](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/blob/master/cookbook/hypothetical_document_embeddings.ipynb). A query generates hypothetical documents, which are then embedded and retrieved to provide the most relevant results. `query -> generate n hypothetical documents -> documents embedding - (avg of embeddings) -> retrieve -> final result.` [ref](https://www.jiang.jp/posts/20230510_hyde_detailed/index.html)

### **The Problem with RAG**

- The Problem with RAG
  1. A question is not semantically similar to its answers. Cosine similarity may favor semantically similar texts that do not contain the answer.
  1. Semantic similarity gets diluted if the document is too long. Cosine similarity may favor short documents with only the relevant information.
  1. The information needs to be contained in one or a few documents. Information that requires aggregations by scanning the whole data.

### **LlamaIndex**

- LlamaIndex (formerly GPT Index) is a data framework for LLM applications to ingest, structure, and access private or domain-specific data. The high-level API allows users to ingest and query their data in a few lines of code. High-Level Concept: [ref](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/latest/getting_started/concepts.html) / doc:[ref](https://gpt-index.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) / blog:[ref](https://www.llamaindex.ai/blog) / [git](https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index) [Nov 2022]

  > Fun fact this core idea was the initial inspiration for GPT Index (the former name of LlamaIndex) 11/8/2022 - almost a year ago!. [cite](https://twitter.com/jerryjliu0/status/1711817419592008037) / [Walking Down the Memory Maze: Beyond Context Limit through Interactive Reading](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05029)

    <summary>High-Level Concepts</summary>

    - Query engine vs Chat engine

      1. The query engine wraps a `retriever` and a `response synthesizer` into a pipeline, that will use the query string to fetch nodes (sentences or paragraphs) from the index and then send them to the LLM (Language and Logic Model) to generate a response
      1. The chat engine is a quick and simple way to chat with the data in your index. It uses a `context manager` to keep track of the conversation history and generate relevant queries for the retriever. Conceptually, it is a `stateful` analogy of a Query Engine.

    - Storage Context vs Settings (p.k.a. Service Context)

      - Both the Storage Context and Service Context are data classes.

      <!-- ```python
      index = load_index_from_storage(storage_context, service_context=service_context)
      ``` -->

      1. Introduced in v0.10.0, ServiceContext is replaced to Settings object.
      1. Storage Context is responsible for the storage and retrieval of data in Llama Index, while the Service Context helps in incorporating external context to enhance the search experience.
      1. The Service Context is not directly involved in the storage or retrieval of data, but it helps in providing a more context-aware and accurate search experience.

     ```python
     # The storage context container is a utility container for storing nodes, indices, and vectors.
     class StorageContext:
       docstore: BaseDocumentStore
       index_store: BaseIndexStore
       vector_store: VectorStore
       graph_store: GraphStore
     ```

     ```python
     # The service context container is a utility container for LlamaIndex index and query classes.
     class ServiceContext:
       llm_predictor: BaseLLMPredictor
       prompt_helper: PromptHelper
       embed_model: BaseEmbedding
       node_parser: NodeParser
       llama_logger: LlamaLogger
       callback_manager: CallbackManager
     ```

    ```python
    @dataclass
    class _Settings:
      # lazy initialization
      _llm: Optional[LLM] = None
      _embed_model: Optional[BaseEmbedding] = None
      _callback_manager: Optional[CallbackManager] = None
      _tokenizer: Optional[Callable[[str], List[Any]]] = None
      _node_parser: Optional[NodeParser] = None

#### **Embedding**

- Azure Open AI Embedding API, `text-embedding-ada-002`, supports 1536 dimensions. Elastic search, Lucene based engine, supports 1024 dimensions as a max. Open search can insert 16,000 dimensions as a vector storage. Open search is available to use as a vector database with Azure Open AI Embedding API.
- OpenAI Embedding models: `text-embedding-3` [x-ref](#openai-products) > `New embedding models`
- [text-embedding-ada-002](https://openai.com/blog/new-and-improved-embedding-model):
  Smaller embedding size. The new embeddings have only 1536 dimensions, one-eighth the size of davinci-001 embeddings,
  making the new embeddings more cost effective in working with vector databases. [15 Dec 2022]
- However, one exception to this is that the maximum dimension count for the Lucene engine is 1,024, compared with
  16,000 for the other engines. [ref](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/search-plugins/knn/approximate-knn/)

- [Vector Search with OpenAI Embeddings: Lucene Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14963): Our experiments were based on Lucene 9.5.0, but indexing was a bit tricky
  because the HNSW implementation in Lucene restricts vectors to 1024 dimensions, which was not sufficient for OpenAI‚Äôs 1536-dimensional embeddings. Although the resolution of this issue, which is to make vector dimensions configurable on a per codec basis, has been merged to the Lucene source trunk [git](https://github.com/apache/lucene/pull/12436), this feature has not been folded into a Lucene release (yet) as of early August 2023.

- [Is Cosine-Similarity of Embeddings Really About Similarity?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05440): In linear matrix factorization, the use of regularization can impact, and in some cases, render cosine similarities meaningless. Regularization involves two objectives. The first objective applies L2-norm regularization to the product of matrices A and B, a process similar to dropout. The second objective applies L2-norm regularization to each individual matrix, similar to the weight decay technique used in deep learning. [8 Mar 2024]

#### **Azure AI Search**

- Azure Cognitive Search rebranding Azure AI Search, it supports Vector search and semantic ranker. [16 Nov 2023]
- In the vector databases category within Azure, several alternative solutions are available. However, the only option that provides a range of choices, including a conventional Lucene-based search engine and a hybrid search incorporating vector search capabilities.
- Vector Search Sample Code: [git](https://github.com/Azure/azure-search-vector-samples) [Apr 2023]
- Azure AI Search (FKA. Azure Cognitive Search) supports
  1. Text Search
  1. Pure Vector Search
  1. Hybrid Search (Text search + Vector search)
  1. Semantic Hybrid Search (Text search + Semantic search + Vector search)
- A set of capabilities designed to improve relevance in these scenarios. We use a combination of hybrid retrieval (vector search + keyword search) + semantic ranking as the most effective approach for improved relevance out-of‚Äìthe-box. `TL;DR: Retrieval Performance; Hybrid search + Semantic rank > Hybrid search > Vector only search > Keyword only` [ref](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-ai-services-blog/azure-cognitive-search-outperforming-vector-search-with-hybrid/ba-p/3929167) [18 Sep 2023] <br/>
  <img src="../files/acs-hybrid.png" alt="acs" width="300"/>
- Hybrid search using Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF): Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) is an algorithm that evaluates the search scores from multiple, previously ranked results to produce a unified result set. In Azure Cognitive Search, RRF is used whenever there are two or more queries that execute in parallel. [ref](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/hybrid-search-ranking)
- [Integrated vectorization](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/ai-azure-ai-services-blog/integrated-vectorization-with-azure-openai-for-azure-ai-search/ba-p/4206836): Automatically splits documents into chunks, creates embeddings with Azure OpenAI, maps them to an Azure AI Search index, and automates query vectorization.

## **Section 3** : Microsoft Semantic Kernel and Stanford NLP DSPy

### **Semantic Kernel**

- Microsoft LangChain Library supports C# and Python and offers several features, some of which are still in development and may be unclear on how to implement. However, it is simple, stable, and faster than Python-based open-source software. The features listed on the link include: [Semantic Kernel Feature Matrix](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/get-started/supported-languages) / doc:[ref](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel) / blog:[ref](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/semantic-kernel/) / [git](https://aka.ms/sk/repo) [Feb 2023]
- .NET Semantic Kernel SDK: 1. Renamed packages and classes that used the term ‚ÄúSkill‚Äù to now use ‚ÄúPlugin‚Äù. 2. OpenAI specific in Semantic Kernel core to be AI service agnostic 3. Consolidated our planner implementations into a single package [ref](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/semantic-kernel/introducing-the-v1-0-0-beta1-for-the-net-semantic-kernel-sdk/) [10 Oct 2023]

### **Micro-orchestration**

- Micro-orchestration in LLM pipelines is the detailed management of LLM interactions, focusing on data flow within tasks.
- e.g., [Semantic Kernel](https://aka.ms/sk/repo), [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/), [LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/), [Haystack](https://haystack.deepset.ai/), and [AdalFlow](https://github.com/SylphAI-Inc/AdalFlow).

#### **Semantic Kernel Planner [deprecated]**

- Semantic Kernel Planner [ref](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/semantic-kernel/semantic-kernel-planners-actionplanner/) [24 Jul 2023]

  <img src="../files/sk-evolution_of_planners.jpg" alt="sk-plan" width="300"/>

- Is Semantic Kernel Planner the same as LangChain agents?

  > Planner in SK is not the same as Agents in LangChain. [cite](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel/discussions/1326) [11 May 2023]

  > Agents in LangChain use recursive calls to the LLM to decide the next step to take based on the current state.
  > The two planner implementations in SK are not self-correcting.
  > Sequential planner tries to produce all the steps at the very beginning, so it is unable to handle unexpected errors.
  > Action planner only chooses one tool to satisfy the goal

- Stepwise Planner released. The Stepwise Planner features the "CreateScratchPad" function, acting as a 'Scratch Pad' to aggregate goal-oriented steps. [16 Aug 2023]

- Use function calling for most tasks; it's more powerful and easier. `Stepwise and Handlebars planners will be deprecated` [ref](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/concepts/planning) [Jun 2024] 

- [The future of Planners in Semantic Kernel](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/semantic-kernel/the-future-of-planners-in-semantic-kernel/) [23 July 2024]

#### **Semantic Function**

- Semantic Function - expressed in natural language in a text file "_skprompt.txt_" using SK's
[Prompt Template language](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel/blob/main/docs/PROMPT_TEMPLATE_LANGUAGE.md).
Each semantic function is defined by a unique prompt template file, developed using modern prompt engineering techniques. [cite](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel/blob/main/docs/GLOSSARY.md)

- Prompt Template language Key takeaways

```bash
1. Variables : use the {{$variableName}} syntax : Hello {{$name}}, welcome to Semantic Kernel!
2. Function calls: use the {{namespace.functionName}} syntax : The weather today is {{weather.getForecast}}.
3. Function parameters: {{namespace.functionName $varName}} and {{namespace.functionName "value"}} syntax
   : The weather today in {{$city}} is {{weather.getForecast $city}}.
4. Prompts needing double curly braces :
   {{ "{{" }} and {{ "}}" }} are special SK sequences.
5. Values that include quotes, and escaping :

    For instance:
    ... {{ 'no need to \\"escape" ' }} ...
    is equivalent to:
    ... {{ 'no need to "escape" ' }} ...
```

### **Optimizer frameworks**

- These frameworks, including DSpy, utilize algorithmic methods inspired by machine learning to improve prompts, outputs, and overall performance in LLM applications.
- [AdalFlow](https://github.com/SylphAI-Inc/AdalFlow):üí°The Library to Build and Auto-optimize LLM Applications [Apr 2024]
- [TextGrad](https://github.com/zou-group/textgrad): automatic ``differentiation` via text. Backpropagation through text feedback provided by LLMs [Jun 2024]

#### **DSPy Glossary**

- Glossary reference to the [ref](https:/towardsdatascience.com/intro-to-dspy-goodbye-prompting-hello-programming-4ca1c6ce3eb9).
  1. Signatures: Hand-written prompts and fine-tuning are abstracted and replaced by signatures.
      > "question -> answer" <br/>
        "long-document -> summary"  <br/>
        "context, question -> answer"  <br/>
  2. Modules: Prompting techniques, such as `Chain of Thought` or `ReAct`, are abstracted and replaced by modules.
      ```python
      # pass a signature to ChainOfThought module
      generate_answer = dspy.ChainOfThought("context, question -> answer")
      ```
  3. Optimizers (formerly Teleprompters): Manual iterations of prompt engineering is automated with optimizers (teleprompters) and a DSPy Compiler.
      ```python
      # Self-generate complete demonstrations. Teacher-student paradigm, `BootstrapFewShotWithOptuna`, `BootstrapFewShotWithRandomSearch` etc. which work on the same principle.
      optimizer = BootstrapFewShot(metric=dspy.evaluate.answer_exact_match)
      ```
  4. DSPy Compiler: Internally trace your program and then optimize it using an optimizer (teleprompter) to maximize a given metric (e.g., improve quality or cost) for your task.
  - e.g., the DSPy compiler optimizes the initial prompt and thus eliminates the need for manual prompt tuning.
    ```python
    cot_compiled = teleprompter.compile(CoT(), trainset=trainset, valset=devset)
    cot_compiled.save('turbo_gsm8k.json')
    ```

#### DSPy optimizer

<details>
  <summary>Expand</summary>

  - Automatic Few-Shot Learning

    - As a rule of thumb, if you don't know where to start, use `BootstrapFewShotWithRandomSearch`.
      
    - If you have very little data, e.g. 10 examples of your task, use `BootstrapFewShot`.
      
    - If you have slightly more data, e.g. 50 examples of your task, use `BootstrapFewShotWithRandomSearch`.
      
    - If you have more data than that, e.g. 300 examples or more, use `BayesianSignatureOptimizer`.
  
  - Automatic Instruction Optimization

    - `COPRO`: Repeat for a set number of iterations, tracking the best-performing instructions.

    - `MIPRO`: Repeat for a set number of iterations, tracking the best-performing combinations (instructions and examples).

  - Automatic Finetuning

    - If you have been able to use one of these with a large LM (e.g., 7B parameters or above) and need a very efficient program, compile that down to a small LM with `BootstrapFinetune`.

## **Section 4** : LangChain Features, Usage, and Comparisons

- LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. (1) Be data-aware: connect a language model to other sources of data.
  (2) Be agentic: Allow a language model to interact with its environment. doc:[ref](https://docs.langchain.com/docs) / blog:[ref](https://blog.langchain.dev) / [git](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain)
- It highlights two main value props of the framework:

  1. Components: modular abstractions and implementations for working with language models, with easy-to-use features.
  2. Use-Case Specific Chains: chains of components that assemble in different ways to achieve specific use cases, with customizable interfaces.cite: [ref](https://docs.langchain.com/docs/)

### **LangChain chain type: Chains & Summarizer**

- Chains [ref](https://github.com/RutamBhagat/LangChainHCCourse1/blob/main/course_1/chains.ipynb)
  - SimpleSequentialChain: A sequence of steps with single input and output. Output of one step is input for the next.
  - SequentialChain: Like SimpleSequentialChain but handles multiple inputs and outputs at each step.
  - MultiPromptChain: Routes inputs to specialized sub-chains based on content. Ideal for different prompts for different tasks.
- Summarizer
  - stuff: Sends everything at once in LLM. If it's too long, an error will occur.
  - map_reduce: Summarizes by dividing and then summarizing the entire summary.
  - refine: (Summary + Next document) => Summary
  - map_rerank: Ranks by score and summarizes to important points.

### **LangChain Agent & Memory**

#### LangChain Agent

1. If you're using a text LLM, first try `zero-shot-react-description`.
1. If you're using a Chat Model, try `chat-zero-shot-react-description`.
1. If you're using a Chat Model and want to use memory, try `conversational-react-description`.
1. `self-ask-with-search`: [Measuring and Narrowing the Compositionality Gap in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03350) [7 Oct 2022]
1. `react-docstore`: [ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629) [6 Oct 2022]
1. Agent Type

```python
class AgentType(str, Enum):
    """Enumerator with the Agent types."""

    ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION = "zero-shot-react-description"
    REACT_DOCSTORE = "react-docstore"
    SELF_ASK_WITH_SEARCH = "self-ask-with-search"
    CONVERSATIONAL_REACT_DESCRIPTION = "conversational-react-description"
    CHAT_ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION = "chat-zero-shot-react-description"
    CHAT_CONVERSATIONAL_REACT_DESCRIPTION = "chat-conversational-react-description"
    STRUCTURED_CHAT_ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION = (
        "structured-chat-zero-shot-react-description"
    )
    OPENAI_FUNCTIONS = "openai-functions"
    OPENAI_MULTI_FUNCTIONS = "openai-multi-functions"
```

- [ReAct](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629) vs [MRKL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.00445) (miracle)

  ReAct is inspired by the synergies between "acting" and "reasoning" which allow humans to learn new tasks and make decisions or reasoning.

  MRKL stands for Modular Reasoning, Knowledge and Language and is a neuro-symbolic architecture that combines large language models, external knowledge sources, and discrete reasoning

  > cite: [ref](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/issues/2284#issuecomment-1526879904) [28 Apr 2023] <br/>
  `zero-shot-react-description`: Uses ReAct to select tools based on their descriptions. Any number of tools can be used, each requiring a description. <br/>
  `react-docstore`: Uses ReAct to manage a docstore with two required tools: _Search_ and _Lookup_. These tools must be named exactly as specified. It follows the original ReAct paper's example from Wikipedia.
  - MRKL in LangChain uses `zero-shot-react-description`, implementing ReAct. The original ReAct framework is used in the `react-docstore` agent. MRKL was published on May 1, 2022, earlier than ReAct on October 6, 2022.

#### LangChain Memory

1. `ConversationBufferMemory`: Stores the entire conversation history.

- LangChain Is Pointless: [ref](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36645575) [Jul 2023]
  > LangChain has been criticized for making simple things relatively complex, which creates unnecessary complexity and tribalism that hurts the up-and-coming AI ecosystem as a whole. The documentation is also criticized for being bad and unhelpful.

However, with a larger number (e.g., hundreds), an additional retrieval step involving a retriever model is often necessary. 2. LM-used tools incl. Tool creation and reuse. Tool is not useful when machine translation, summarization, and sentiment analysis (among others).  3. Evaluation metrics [18 Mar 2024]

#### **LangChain vs LlamaIndex**

- Basically LlamaIndex is a smart storage mechanism, while LangChain is a tool to bring multiple tools together. [cite](https://community.openai.com/t/llamaindex-vs-langchain-which-one-should-be-used/163139) [14 Apr 2023]

- LangChain offers many features and focuses on using chains and agents to connect with external APIs. In contrast, LlamaIndex is more specialized and excels at indexing data and retrieving documents.

#### **LangChain vs Semantic Kernel vs Azure Machine Learning Prompt flow**

- What's the difference between LangChain and Semantic Kernel?

  LangChain has many agents, tools, plugins etc. out of the box. More over, LangChain has 10x more popularity, so has about 10x more developer activity to improve it. On other hand, **Semantic Kernel architecture and quality is better**, that's quite promising for Semantic Kernel. [ref](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel/discussions/1326) [11 May 2023]

- What's the difference between Azure Machine Learing PromptFlow and Semantic Kernel?

  1. Low/No Code vs C#, Python, Java
  1. Focused on Prompt orchestrating vs Integrate LLM into their existing app.

- Promptflow is not intended to replace chat conversation flow. Instead, it‚Äôs an optimized solution for integrating Search and Open Source Language Models. By default, it supports Python, LLM, and the Prompt tool as its fundamental building blocks.

     ```python
     params = (p for n,p in model.named_parameters() if "bias" in n)
     optimizer = Optimizer(params)
     ```

  1. Reparametrization: LoRa - Low-rank decomposition. Efficient, Complex to implement.

     ```python

       h = x @ W # regular linear
       h += x @ W_A @ W_B # low_rank update
       return scale * h

       - `LoRA` introduces low-rank matrices A and B that are trained, while the pre-trained weight matrix W is frozen.
       - `LoRA+` suggests having a much higher learning rate for B than for A.
       - `VeRA` does not train A and B, but initializes them randomly and trains new vectors d and b on top.
       - `LoRA-FA` only trains matrix B.
       - `LoRA-drop` uses the output of B*A to determine, which layers are worth to be trained at all.
       - `AdaLoRA` adapts the ranks of A and B in different layers dynamically, allowing for a higher rank in these layers, where more contribution to the model‚Äôs performance is expected.
       - `DoRA` splits the LoRA adapter into two components of magnitude and direction and allows to train them more independently.
       - `Delta-LoRA` changes the weights of W by the gradient of A*B.

  - Key-Value (KV) cache is an important component in the StreamingLLM framework.

  1. Window Attention: Only the most recent Key and Value states (KVs) are cached. This approach fails when the text length surpasses the cache size.
  2. Sliding Attention /w Re-computation: Rebuilds the Key-Value (KV) states from the recent tokens for each new token. Evicts the oldest part of the cache.
  3. StreamingLLM: One of the techniques used is to add a placeholder token (yellow-colored) as a dedicated attention sink during pre-training. This attention sink attracts the model‚Äôs attention and helps it generalize to longer sequences. Outperforms the sliding window with re-computation baseline by up to a remarkable 22.2√ó speedup.

  1. Regular pretraining: A model is initialized with random weights and pretrained on dataset D1.
  2. Continued pretraining: The pretrained model from 1) is further pretrained on dataset D2.
  3. Retraining on combined dataset: A model is initialized with random weights and trained on the combined datasets D1 and D2.

  Continued pretraining can be as effective as retraining on combined datasets. Key strategies for successful continued pretraining include:

  1. Re-warming: Increasing the learning rate at the start of continued pre-training.
  2. Re-decaying: Gradually reducing the learning rate afterwards.
  3. Data Mixing: Adding a small portion (e.g., 5%) of the original pretraining data (D1) to the new dataset (D2) to prevent catastrophic forgetting.

- [Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.08593)) is a process of pretraining and retraining a language model using human feedback to develop a scoring algorithm that can be reapplied at scale for future training and refinement. As the algorithm is refined to match the human-provided grading, direct human feedback is no longer needed, and the language model continues learning and improving using algorithmic grading alone.

### **Memory Optimization**

- Transformer cache key-value tensors of context tokens into GPU memory to facilitate fast generation of the next token. However, these caches occupy significant GPU memory. The unpredictable nature of cache size, due to the variability in the length of each request, exacerbates the issue, resulting in significant memory fragmentation in the absence of a suitable memory management mechanism.
- To alleviate this issue, PagedAttention was proposed to store the KV cache in non-contiguous memory spaces. It partitions the KV cache of each sequence into multiple blocks, with each block containing the keys and values for a fixed number of tokens.

- GPT-4 details leaked
  - GPT-4 is a language model with approximately 1.8 trillion parameters across 120 layers, 10x larger than GPT-3. It uses a Mixture of Experts (MoE) model with 16 experts, each having about 111 billion parameters. Utilizing MoE allows for more efficient use of resources during inference, needing only about 280 billion parameters and 560 TFLOPs, compared to the 1.8 trillion parameters and 3,700 TFLOPs required for a purely dense model.
  - The model is trained on approximately 13 trillion tokens from various sources, including internet data, books, and research papers. To reduce training costs, OpenAI employs tensor and pipeline parallelism, and a large batch size of 60 million. The estimated training cost for GPT-4 is around $63 million.

  1. Microsoft's Structured Prompting allows thousands of examples, by first concatenating examples into groups, then inputting each group into the LM. The hidden key and value vectors of the LM's attention modules are cached. Finally, when the user's unaltered input prompt is passed to the LM, the cached attention vectors are injected into the hidden layers of the LM.
  2. This approach wouldn't work with OpenAI's closed models. because this needs to access [keys] and [values] in the transformer internals, which they do not expose. You could implement yourself on OSS ones. [cite](https://www.infoq.com/news/2023/02/microsoft-lmops-tools/) [07 Feb 2023]

## **Section 7** : Large Language Model: Landscape

### **Large Language Models (in 2023)**

1. Change in perspective is necessary because some abilities only emerge at a certain scale. Some conclusions from the past are invalidated and we need to constantly unlearn intuitions built on top of such ideas.
1. From first-principles, scaling up the Transformer amounts to efficiently doing matrix multiplications with many, many machines.
1. Further scaling (think 10000x GPT-4 scale). It entails finding the inductive bias that is the bottleneck in further scaling.

  - `Q-Former (Querying Transformer)`: A transformer model that consists of two submodules that share the same self-attention layers: an image transformer that interacts with a frozen image encoder for visual feature extraction, and a text transformer that can function as both a text encoder and a text decoder.
  - Q-Former is a lightweight transformer which employs a set of learnable query vectors to extract visual features from the frozen image encoder. It acts as an information bottleneck between the frozen image encoder and the frozen LLM.

| Model | Description | Strengths | Weaknesses |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GANs | Two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, work together. The generator creates synthetic samples, and the discriminator distinguishes between real and generated samples. | Unsupervised learning, able to mimic data distributions without labeled data, and are versatile in applications like image synthesis, super-resolution, and style transfer | Known for potentially unstable training and less diversity in generation. |
| VAEs | Consists of an encoder and a decoder. The encoder maps input data into a low-dimensional representation, and the decoder reconstructs the original input data from this representation. e.g, `DALLE` | Efficient at learning latent representations and can be used for tasks like data denoising and anomaly detection, in addition to data generation. | Dependent on an approximate loss function. |
| Diffusion Models | Consists of forward and reverse diffusion processes. Forward diffusion adds noise to input data until white noise is obtained. The reverse diffusion process removes the noise to recover the original data.  e.g, `Stable Diffusion` | Capable of producing high-quality, step-by-step samples. | Multi-step (often 1000) generation process. |

- An unnecessarily tiny implementation of GPT-2 in NumPy. [picoGPT](https://github.com/jaymody/picoGPT): Transformer Decoder [Jan 2023]

  ```python
  q = x @ w_k # [n_seq, n_embd] @ [n_embd, n_embd] -> [n_seq, n_embd]
  k = x @ w_q # [n_seq, n_embd] @ [n_embd, n_embd] -> [n_seq, n_embd]
  v = x @ w_v # [n_seq, n_embd] @ [n_embd, n_embd] -> [n_seq, n_embd]

  # In picoGPT, combine w_q, w_k and w_v into a single matrix w_fc
  x = x @ w_fc # [n_seq, n_embd] @ [n_embd, 3*n_embd] -> [n_seq, 3*n_embd]
  ```

  - Beam Search [1977] in Transformers is an inference algorithm that maintains the `beam_size` most probable sequences until the end token appears or maximum sequence length is reached. If `beam_size` (k) is 1, it's a `Greedy Search`. If k equals the total vocabularies, it's an `Exhaustive Search`. [ref](https://huggingface.co/blog/constrained-beam-search) [Mar 2022]

  #### Classification of Attention

  - [ref](https://arize.com/blog-course/attention-mechanisms-in-machine-learning/): Must-Read Starter Guide to Mastering Attention Mechanisms in Machine Learning [12 Jun 2023]

  1. Encoder-Decoder Attention:

     1. Soft Attention: assigns continuous weights to input elements, allowing the model to attend to multiple elements simultaneously. Used in neural machine translation.
     1. Hard Attention: selects a subset of input elements to focus on while ignoring the rest. Used in image captioning.
     1. Global Attention: focuses on all elements of the input sequence when computing attention weights. Captures long-range dependencies and global context.
     1. Local Attention: focuses on a smaller, localized region of the input sequence when computing attention weights. Reduces computational complexity. Used in time series analysis.

  1. Extended Forms of Attention: Only one Decoder component (only Input Sequence, no Target Sequence)

     1. Self Attention: attends to different parts of the input sequence itself, rather than another sequence or modality. Captures long-range dependencies and contextual information. Used in transformer models.
     1. Multi-head Self-Attention: performs self-attention multiple times in parallel, allowing the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces.
     <!-- 1. Hierarchical Attention: attends to different levels of granularity in the input sequence, allowing the model to capture both local and global context. -->

  1. Other Types of Attention:

     1. Sparse Attention: reduces computation by focusing on a limited selection of similarity scores in a sequence, resulting in a sparse matrix. It includes implementations of ‚Äústrided‚Äù and ‚Äúfixed‚Äù attention. [ref](https://blog.research.google/2020/10/rethinking-attention-with-performers.html) [23 Oct 2020]

     <!-- <img src="../files/rethinking-attention-with-performers.gif"/> -->

     1. Cross-Attention: mixes two different embedding sequences, allowing the model to attend to information from both sequences. In a Transformer, when the information is passed from encoder to decoder that part is known as Cross Attention. [ref](https://vaclavkosar.com/ml/cross-attention-in-transformer-architecture) / [ref](https://sebastianraschka.com/blog/2023/self-attention-from-scratch.html) [9 Feb 2023]

     1. Sliding Window Attention (SWA): A technique used Longformer. It uses a fixed-size window of attention around each token, which allows the model to scale efficiently to long inputs. Each token attends to half the window size tokens on each side. [ref](https://github.com/mistralai/mistral-src#sliding-window-to-speed-up-inference-and-reduce-memory-pressure)

  1. Used GPT-4 to generate a dataset of instruction-api pairs for fine-tuning Gorilla.
  1. Used the abstract syntax tree (AST) of the generated code to match with APIs in the database and test set for evaluation purposes.

  > Another user asked how Gorilla compared to LangChain; Patil replied: LangChain is a terrific project that tries to teach agents how to use tools using prompting. Our take on this is that prompting is not scalable if you want to pick between 1000s of APIs. So Gorilla is a LLM that can pick and write the semantically and syntactically correct API for you to call! A drop in replacement into LangChain!

### **Caching**

- Caching: A technique to store data that has been previously retrieved or computed, so that future requests for the same data can be served faster.
- To reduce latency, cost, and LLM requests by serving pre-computed or previously served responses.
- Strategies for caching: Caching can be based on item IDs, pairs of item IDs, constrained input, or pre-computation. Caching can also leverage embedding-based retrieval, approximate nearest neighbor search, and LLM-based evaluation. [ref](https://eugeneyan.com/writing/llm-patterns/#caching-to-reduce-latency-and-cost)

### **Defensive UX**

- Defensive UX: A design strategy that aims to prevent and handle errors in user interactions with machine learning or LLM-based products.
- Why defensive UX?: Machine learning and LLMs can produce inaccurate or inconsistent output, which can affect user trust and satisfaction. Defensive UX can help by increasing accessibility, trust, and UX quality.
- [Guidelines for Human-AI Interaction](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/guidelines-for-human-ai-interaction/): Microsoft: Based on a survey of 168 potential guidelines from various sources, they narrowed it down to 18 action rules organized by user interaction stages.

### **Evaluation metrics**

  1. Automated evaluation of LLMs

  - n-gram based metrics: Evaluates the model using n-gram statistics and F1 score. ROUGE, BLEU, and METEOR are used for summarization and translation tasks.
  - Probabilistic model evaluation metrics: Evaluates the model using the predictive performance of probability models. Perplexity.
  - Embedding based metrics: Evaluates the model using semantic similarity of embeddings. Ada Similarity and BERTScore are used.

    <details>
    <summary>Expand</summary>

      - ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation): The metrics compare an automatically produced summary or translation against a reference or a set of references (human-produced) summary or translation. It includes several measures such as:

        1. ROUGE-N: Overlap of n-grams between the system and reference summaries.
        2. ROUGE-L: Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) based statistics.
        3. ROUGE-W: Weighted LCS-based statistics that favor consecutive LCSes.
        4. ROUGE-S: Skip-bigram based co-occurrence statistics.
        5. ROUGE-SU: Skip-bigram plus unigram-based co-occurrence statistics1.

      - n-gram: An n-gram is a contiguous sequence of n items from a given sample of text or speech. For example, in the sentence ‚ÄúI love AI‚Äù, the unigrams (1-gram) are ‚ÄúI‚Äù, ‚Äúlove‚Äù, ‚ÄúAI‚Äù; the bigrams (2-gram) are ‚ÄúI love‚Äù, ‚Äúlove AI‚Äù; and the trigram (3-gram) is ‚ÄúI love AI‚Äù.

      - BLEU: BLEU‚Äôs output is always a number between 0 and 1. An algorithm for evaluating the quality of machine-translated text. The closer a machine translation is to a professional human translation, the better it is.

      - BERTScore: A metric that leverages pre-trained contextual embeddings from BERT for text generation tasks. It combines precision and recall values.

      - Perplexity: A measure of a model's predictive performance, with lower values indicating better prediction.
      - METEOR: An n-gram based metric for machine translation, considering precision, recall, and semantic similarity.
    </details>

  2. Human evaluation of LLMs (possibly Automate by LLM-based metrics): Evaluate the model‚Äôs performance on NLU and NLG tasks. It includes evaluations of relevance, fluency, coherence, and groundedness.

  3. Built-in evaluation methods in Prompt flow: [ref](https://qiita.com/nohanaga/items/b68bf5a65142c5af7969) [Aug 2023] / [ref](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/prompt-flow/how-to-bulk-test-evaluate-flow)

   - On that note, in the satirical¬†Pretraining on the Test Set Is All You Need¬†paper, the author trains a small 1M parameter LLM that outperforms all other models, including the 1.3B phi-1.5 model. This is achieved by training the model on all downstream academic benchmarks. It appears to be a subtle criticism underlining how easily benchmarks can be "cheated" intentionally or unintentionally (due to data contamination). [cite](https://twitter.com/rasbt) [13 Sep 2023]
