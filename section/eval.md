### **Evaluation metrics**

  1. Automated evaluation of LLMs

  - n-gram based metrics: Evaluates the model using n-gram statistics and F1 score. ROUGE, BLEU, and METEOR are used for summarization and translation tasks.
  - Probabilistic model evaluation metrics: Evaluates the model using the predictive performance of probability models. Perplexity.
  - Embedding based metrics: Evaluates the model using semantic similarity of embeddings. Ada Similarity and BERTScore are used.

    <details open>
    <summary>Expand</summary>

      - ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation): The metrics compare an automatically produced summary or translation against a reference or a set of references (human-produced) summary or translation. It includes several measures such as:

        1. ROUGE-N: Overlap of n-grams between the system and reference summaries.
        2. ROUGE-L: Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) based statistics.
        3. ROUGE-W: Weighted LCS-based statistics that favor consecutive LCSes.
        4. ROUGE-S: Skip-bigram based co-occurrence statistics.
        5. ROUGE-SU: Skip-bigram plus unigram-based co-occurrence statistics1.

      - n-gram: An n-gram is a contiguous sequence of n items from a given sample of text or speech. For example, in the sentence “I love AI”, the unigrams (1-gram) are “I”, “love”, “AI”; the bigrams (2-gram) are “I love”, “love AI”; and the trigram (3-gram) is “I love AI”.

      - BLEU: BLEU’s output is always a number between 0 and 1. An algorithm for evaluating the quality of machine-translated text. The closer a machine translation is to a professional human translation, the better it is.

      - BERTScore: A metric that leverages pre-trained contextual embeddings from BERT for text generation tasks. It combines precision and recall values.

      - Perplexity: A measure of a model's predictive performance, with lower values indicating better prediction.
      - METEOR: An n-gram based metric for machine translation, considering precision, recall, and semantic similarity.

  2. Human evaluation of LLMs (possibly Automate by LLM-based metrics): Evaluate the model’s performance on NLU and NLG tasks. It includes evaluations of relevance, fluency, coherence, and groundedness.

### **Challenges in evaluating AI systems**

1. [Pretraining on the Test Set Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08632): [[cnt](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=arxiv%3A+2309.08632)]
   - On that note, in the satirical Pretraining on the Test Set Is All You Need paper, the author trains a small 1M parameter LLM that outperforms all other models, including the 1.3B phi-1.5 model. This is achieved by training the model on all downstream academic benchmarks. It appears to be a subtle criticism underlining how easily benchmarks can be "cheated" intentionally or unintentionally (due to data contamination). [cite](https://twitter.com/rasbt) [13 Sep 2023]
