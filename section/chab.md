- GPT-4 details leaked
  - GPT-4 is a language model with approximately 1.8 trillion parameters across 120 layers, 10x larger than GPT-3. It uses a Mixture of Experts (MoE) model with 16 experts, each having about 111 billion parameters. Utilizing MoE allows for more efficient use of resources during inference, needing only about 280 billion parameters and 560 TFLOPs, compared to the 1.8 trillion parameters and 3,700 TFLOPs required for a purely dense model.
  - The model is trained on approximately 13 trillion tokens from various sources, including internet data, books, and research papers. To reduce training costs, OpenAI employs tensor and pipeline parallelism, and a large batch size of 60 million. The estimated training cost for GPT-4 is around $63 million.

  - How is this different from the sinusoidal embeddings used in "Attention is All You Need"?
    1. Sinusoidal embeddings apply to each coordinate individually, while rotary embeddings mix pairs of coordinates
    2. Sinusoidal embeddings add a `cos` or `sin` term, while rotary embeddings use a multiplicative factor.
    3. Rotary embeddings are applied to positional encoding to K and V, not to the input embeddings.

  1. Microsoft's Structured Prompting allows thousands of examples, by first concatenating examples into groups, then inputting each group into the LM. The hidden key and value vectors of the LM's attention modules are cached. Finally, when the user's unaltered input prompt is passed to the LM, the cached attention vectors are injected into the hidden layers of the LM.
  2. This approach wouldn't work with OpenAI's closed models. because this needs to access [keys] and [values] in the transformer internals, which they do not expose. You could implement yourself on OSS ones. [‚úçÔ∏è](https://www.infoq.com/news/2023/02/microsoft-lmops-tools/) [07 Feb 2023]

Ring Attention, which leverages blockwise computation of self-attention to distribute long sequences across multiple devices while overlapping the communication of key-value blocks with the computation of blockwise attention. 2. Ring Attention can reduce the memory requirements of Transformers, enabling us to train more than 500 times longer sequence than prior memory efficient state-of-the-arts and enables the training of sequences that exceed 100 million in length without making approximations to attention. 3. we propose an enhancement to the blockwise parallel transformers (BPT) framework.
