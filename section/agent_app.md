  1. Used GPT-4 to generate a dataset of instruction-api pairs for fine-tuning Gorilla.
  1. Used the abstract syntax tree (AST) of the generated code to match with APIs in the database and test set for evaluation purposes.

  > Another user asked how Gorilla compared to LangChain; Patil replied: LangChain is a terrific project that tries to teach agents how to use tools using prompting. Our take on this is that prompting is not scalable if you want to pick between 1000s of APIs. So Gorilla is a LLM that can pick and write the semantically and syntactically correct API for you to call! A drop in replacement into LangChain!

### **Caching**

- Caching: A technique to store data that has been previously retrieved or computed, so that future requests for the same data can be served faster.
- To reduce latency, cost, and LLM requests by serving pre-computed or previously served responses.
- Strategies for caching: Caching can be based on item IDs, pairs of item IDs, constrained input, or pre-computation. Caching can also leverage embedding-based retrieval, approximate nearest neighbor search, and LLM-based evaluation. [ref](https://eugeneyan.com/writing/llm-patterns/#caching-to-reduce-latency-and-cost)

### **Defensive UX**

- Defensive UX: A design strategy that aims to prevent and handle errors in user interactions with machine learning or LLM-based products.
- Why defensive UX?: Machine learning and LLMs can produce inaccurate or inconsistent output, which can affect user trust and satisfaction. Defensive UX can help by increasing accessibility, trust, and UX quality.
- [Guidelines for Human-AI Interaction](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/guidelines-for-human-ai-interaction/): Microsoft: Based on a survey of 168 potential guidelines from various sources, they narrowed it down to 18 action rules organized by user interaction stages.
