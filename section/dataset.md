## **Datasets for LLM Training**

- LLM-generated datasets:
  1. [Self-Instruct](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10560): [[cnt](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=arxiv%3A+2212.10560)]: Seed task pool with a set of human-written instructions. [20 Dec 2022]
  1. [Self-Alignment with Instruction Backtranslation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06259): [[cnt](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=arxiv%3A+2308.06259)]: Without human seeding, use LLM to produce instruction-response pairs. The process involves two steps: self-augmentation and self-curation. [11 Aug 2023]
