## **Section 1: RAG, LlamaIndex, and Vector Storage**

### **What is the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)?**

- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) : Integrates the retrieval (searching) into LLM text generation. RAG helps the model to ‚Äúlook up‚Äù external information to improve its responses. [cite](https://towardsdatascience.com/rag-vs-finetuning-which-is-the-best-tool-to-boost-your-llm-application-94654b1eaba7) [25 Aug 2023]

- In a 2020 paper, Meta (Facebook) came up with a framework called retrieval-augmented generation to give LLMs access to information beyond their training data. [Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11401): [[cnt](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=arxiv%3A+2005.11401)] [22 May 2020]

  1. RAG-sequence ‚Äî We retrieve k documents, and use them to generate all the output tokens that answer a user query.
  1. RAG-token‚Äî We retrieve k documents, use them to generate the next token, then retrieve k more documents, use them to generate the next token, and so on. This means that we could end up retrieving several different sets of documents in the generation of a single answer to a user‚Äôs query.
  1. Of the two approaches proposed in the paper, the RAG-sequence implementation is pretty much always used in the industry. It‚Äôs cheaper and simpler to run than the alternative, and it produces great results.

  1. Indexing Stage: Preparing a knowledge base.
  2. Querying Stage: Querying the indexed data to retrieve relevant information.

  1. Data quality: Clean, standardize, deduplicate, segment, annotate, augment, and update data to make it clear, consistent, and context-rich.
  2. Embeddings fine-tuning: Fine-tune embeddings to domain specifics, adjust them according to context, and refresh them periodically to capture evolving semantics.
  3. Retrieval optimization: Refine chunking, embed metadata, use query routing, multi-vector retrieval, re-ranking, hybrid search, recursive retrieval, query engine, [HyDE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10496) [20 Dec 2022], and vector search algorithms to improve retrieval efficiency and relevance.
  4. Synthesis techniques: Query transformations, prompt templating, prompt conditioning, function calling, and fine-tuning the generator to refine the generation step.
  - HyDE: Implemented in [LangChain: HypotheticalDocumentEmbedder](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/blob/master/cookbook/hypothetical_document_embeddings.ipynb). A query generates hypothetical documents, which are then embedded and retrieved to provide the most relevant results. `query -> generate n hypothetical documents -> documents embedding - (avg of embeddings) -> retrieve -> final result.` [ref](https://www.jiang.jp/posts/20230510_hyde_detailed/index.html)

### **The Problem with RAG**

- The Problem with RAG
  1. A question is not semantically similar to its answers. Cosine similarity may favor semantically similar texts that do not contain the answer.
  1. Semantic similarity gets diluted if the document is too long. Cosine similarity may favor short documents with only the relevant information.
  1. The information needs to be contained in one or a few documents. Information that requires aggregations by scanning the whole data.

### **LlamaIndex**

- LlamaIndex (formerly GPT Index) is a data framework for LLM applications to ingest, structure, and access private or domain-specific data. The high-level API allows users to ingest and query their data in a few lines of code.

    - Query engine vs Chat engine

      1. The query engine wraps a `retriever` and a `response synthesizer` into a pipeline, that will use the query string to fetch nodes (sentences or paragraphs) from the index and then send them to the LLM (Language and Logic Model) to generate a response
      1. The chat engine is a quick and simple way to chat with the data in your index. It uses a `context manager` to keep track of the conversation history and generate relevant queries for the retriever. Conceptually, it is a `stateful` analogy of a Query Engine.

    - Storage Context vs Settings (p.k.a. Service Context)

      - Both the Storage Context and Service Context are data classes.

      <!-- ```python
      index = load_index_from_storage(storage_context, service_context=service_context)
      ``` -->

      1. Introduced in v0.10.0, ServiceContext is replaced to Settings object.
      1. Storage Context is responsible for the storage and retrieval of data in Llama Index, while the Service Context helps in incorporating external context to enhance the search experience.
      1. The Service Context is not directly involved in the storage or retrieval of data, but it helps in providing a more context-aware and accurate search experience.

     ```python
     # The storage context container is a utility container for storing nodes, indices, and vectors.
     class StorageContext:
       docstore: BaseDocumentStore
       index_store: BaseIndexStore
       vector_store: VectorStore
       graph_store: GraphStore
     ```

     ```python
     # The service context container is a utility container for LlamaIndex index and query classes.
     class ServiceContext:
       llm_predictor: BaseLLMPredictor
       prompt_helper: PromptHelper
       embed_model: BaseEmbedding
       node_parser: NodeParser
       llama_logger: LlamaLogger
       callback_manager: CallbackManager
     ```

    ```python
    @dataclass
    class _Settings:
      # lazy initialization
      _llm: Optional[LLM] = None
      _embed_model: Optional[BaseEmbedding] = None
      _callback_manager: Optional[CallbackManager] = None
      _tokenizer: Optional[Callable[[str], List[Any]]] = None
      _node_parser: Optional[NodeParser] = None

<summary>Expand: 4 RAG techniques</summary>

  1. SQL Router Query Engine: Query router that can reference your vector database or SQL database

  2. Sub Question Query Engine: Break down the complex question into sub-questions

  3. Recursive Retriever + Query Engine: Reference node relationships, rather than only finding a node (chunk) that is most relevant.
  
  4. Self Correcting Query Engines: Use an LLM to evaluate its own output.

#### **Embedding**

- Azure Open AI Embedding API, `text-embedding-ada-002`, supports 1536 dimensions. Elastic search, Lucene based engine, supports 1024 dimensions as a max. Open search can insert 16,000 dimensions as a vector storage. Open search is available to use as a vector database with Azure Open AI Embedding API.
- OpenAI Embedding models: `text-embedding-3` [x-ref](chab.md/#openai-products) > `New embedding models`
- [text-embedding-ada-002](https://openai.com/blog/new-and-improved-embedding-model):
  Smaller embedding size. The new embeddings have only 1536 dimensions, one-eighth the size of davinci-001 embeddings,
  making the new embeddings more cost effective in working with vector databases. [15 Dec 2022]
- However, one exception to this is that the maximum dimension count for the Lucene engine is 1,024, compared with
  16,000 for the other engines. [ref](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/search-plugins/knn/approximate-knn/)

- [Vector Search with OpenAI Embeddings: Lucene Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14963): Our experiments were based on Lucene 9.5.0, but indexing was a bit tricky
  because the HNSW implementation in Lucene restricts vectors to 1024 dimensions, which was not sufficient for OpenAI‚Äôs 1536-dimensional embeddings. Although the resolution of this issue, which is to make vector dimensions configurable on a per codec basis, has been merged to the Lucene source trunk [git](https://github.com/apache/lucene/pull/12436), this feature has not been folded into a Lucene release (yet) as of early August 2023.

- [Is Cosine-Similarity of Embeddings Really About Similarity?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05440): In linear matrix factorization, the use of regularization can impact, and in some cases, render cosine similarities meaningless. Regularization involves two objectives. The first objective applies L2-norm regularization to the product of matrices A and B, a process similar to dropout. The second objective applies L2-norm regularization to each individual matrix, similar to the weight decay technique used in deep learning. [8 Mar 2024]
