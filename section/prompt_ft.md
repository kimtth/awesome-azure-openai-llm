       - `LoRA` introduces low-rank matrices A and B that are trained, while the pre-trained weight matrix W is frozen.
       - `LoRA+` suggests having a much higher learning rate for B than for A.
       - `VeRA` does not train A and B, but initializes them randomly and trains new vectors d and b on top.
       - `LoRA-FA` only trains matrix B.
       - `LoRA-drop` uses the output of B*A to determine, which layers are worth to be trained at all.
       - `AdaLoRA` adapts the ranks of A and B in different layers dynamically, allowing for a higher rank in these layers, where more contribution to the model’s performance is expected.
       - `DoRA` splits the LoRA adapter into two components of magnitude and direction and allows to train them more independently.
       - `Delta-LoRA` changes the weights of W by the gradient of A*B.

  - Key-Value (KV) cache is an important component in the StreamingLLM framework.

  1. Window Attention: Only the most recent Key and Value states (KVs) are cached. This approach fails when the text length surpasses the cache size.
  2. Sliding Attention /w Re-computation: Rebuilds the Key-Value (KV) states from the recent tokens for each new token. Evicts the oldest part of the cache.
  3. StreamingLLM: One of the techniques used is to add a placeholder token (yellow-colored) as a dedicated attention sink during pre-training. This attention sink attracts the model’s attention and helps it generalize to longer sequences. Outperforms the sliding window with re-computation baseline by up to a remarkable 22.2× speedup.

  1. Regular pretraining: A model is initialized with random weights and pretrained on dataset D1.
  2. Continued pretraining: The pretrained model from 1) is further pretrained on dataset D2.
  3. Retraining on combined dataset: A model is initialized with random weights and trained on the combined datasets D1 and D2.

  Continued pretraining can be as effective as retraining on combined datasets. Key strategies for successful continued pretraining include:

  1. Re-warming: Increasing the learning rate at the start of continued pre-training.
  2. Re-decaying: Gradually reducing the learning rate afterwards.
  3. Data Mixing: Adding a small portion (e.g., 5%) of the original pretraining data (D1) to the new dataset (D2) to prevent catastrophic forgetting.

      1. Although dense global attention is needed during inference, fine-tuning the model can be done by sparse local attention, shift short attention (S2-Attn).
      1. S2-Attn can be implemented with only two lines of code in training.

      # Separate the last dimension pairs of two values, representing the real and imaginary parts of the complex number
      # Two consecutive values will become a single complex number

      x_complex = torch.view_as_complex(x.float().reshape(*x.shape[:-1], -1, 2))
      # Reshape the freqs_complex tensor to match the shape of the x_complex tensor. So we need to add the batch dimension and the head dimension

- [Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.08593)) is a process of pretraining and retraining a language model using human feedback to develop a scoring algorithm that can be reapplied at scale for future training and refinement. As the algorithm is refined to match the human-provided grading, direct human feedback is no longer needed, and the language model continues learning and improving using algorithmic grading alone. [18 Sep 2019] [ref](https://huggingface.co/blog/rlhf) [9 Dec 2022]
  - `Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)` is a reinforcement learning method using first-order optimization. It modifies the objective function to penalize large policy changes, specifically those that move the probability ratio away from 1.

RLHF can be complex because it requires fitting a reward model and performing significant hyperparameter tuning. On the other hand, DPO directly solves a classification problem on human preference data in just one stage of policy training. DPO more stable, efficient, and computationally lighter than RLHF. 2. `Your Language Model Is Secretly a Reward Model`  [29 May 2023]
  - Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) uses two models: a trained model (or policy model) and a reference model (copy of trained model). The goal is to have the trained model output higher probabilities for preferred answers and lower probabilities for rejected answers compared to the reference model.

## **Model Compression for Large Language Models**

- A Survey on Model Compression for Large Language Models [ref](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07633) [15 Aug 2023]

### **Quantization Techniques**

- Quantization-aware training (QAT): The model is further trained with quantization in mind after being initially trained in floating-point precision.
- Post-training quantization (PTQ): The model is quantized after it has been trained without further optimization during the quantization process.

  | Method                      | Pros                                                        | Cons                                                                                 |
  | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
  | Post-training quantization  | Easy to use, no need to retrain the model                   | May result in accuracy loss                                                          |
  | Quantization-aware training | Can achieve higher accuracy than post-training quantization | Requires retraining the model, can be more complex to implement                      |

### **Memory Optimization**

- Transformer cache key-value tensors of context tokens into GPU memory to facilitate fast generation of the next token. However, these caches occupy significant GPU memory. The unpredictable nature of cache size, due to the variability in the length of each request, exacerbates the issue, resulting in significant memory fragmentation in the absence of a suitable memory management mechanism.
- To alleviate this issue, PagedAttention was proposed to store the KV cache in non-contiguous memory spaces. It partitions the KV cache of each sequence into multiple blocks, with each block containing the keys and values for a fixed number of tokens.
- [PagedAttention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06180) : vLLM: Easy, Fast, and Cheap LLM Serving with PagedAttention, 24x Faster LLM Inference [doc](../files/vLLM_pagedattention.pdf). [ref](https://vllm.ai/) [12 Sep 2023]
