Many weekends, I drive a few minutes from my house to a local pizza store to buy \na slice of Hawaiian pizza from the gentleman that owns this pizza store. And his pizza is great, but he always \nhas a lot of cold pizzas sitting around, and every weekend some different flavor of pizza is out of stock. \nBut when I watch him operate his store, I get excited, because by selling pizza, he is generating data. \nAnd this is data that he can take advantage of if he had access to AI.\n\nAI systems are good at spotting patterns when given access to the right data, and perhaps an AI system could spot \nif Mediterranean pizzas sell really well on a Friday night, maybe it could suggest to him to make more of it on a \nFriday afternoon. Now you might say to me, \"Hey, Andrew, this is a small pizza store. What's the big deal?\" And I \nsay, to the gentleman that owns this pizza store, something that could help him improve his revenues by a few \nthousand dollars a year, that will be a huge deal to him.\n\"\"\";\n# Text source: https://www.ted.com/talks/andrew_ng_how_ai_could_empower_any_business/transcript\n\nsummary_result = await kernel.run_async(summary_function, input_str=sk_input)\n\ndisplay(Markdown(\"### ✨ \" + str(summary_result)))"
